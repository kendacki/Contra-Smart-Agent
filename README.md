## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **"Please highlight text first":**

    * If it still fails, **refresh the Contra page** and try again. The extension needs to reload the page to "see" it.
* **"API Key Error":**
    * Ensure you copied the key correctly from Google AI Studio.
    * Ensure your Google Cloud billing/account is active (even for the free tier).
* **Icon not showing:**
